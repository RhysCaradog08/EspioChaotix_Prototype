# EspioChaotix_Prototype
Attempt to make a Sonic-esque 3D player controller based around the character of Espio the Chameleon.  Character to have basic movement actions: Idle, Walk, Run, Jump, Fall. Spin action to act as a spinning top where player can bounce off of enemies after attacking to give a Beyblade like feel to combat.
